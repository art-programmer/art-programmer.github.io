<big><big>Project 4: Dynamic Textures<br>
</big></big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Description of
Implementation:<br>
</span>I implemented the paper, Dynamic Textures, by Stefano Soatto. As
the paper explained, I first run PCA on the image sequence Y to build
image bases and associate each image with coefficient vector X. The
number of components is denoted as n. Then the algorithm learns how to
predict next frame based on precedent frames by solving equation X(i) =
A*[X(i - 1), X(i - 2), ..., X(i - k)] + v. We can use the equation (10)
in the paper to solve X or equivalently solve the system of linear
equations
(ignoring v). The number of precedent frames to be considered is
denoted as k. Then v subjects to
Normal distribution and its variance Q is estimated as equation (12) in
the paper. With A and v, we can predict the coefficient vector for a
new frame based on precedent frames and reconstruct the image based on
the coefficient vector. We can repeat predicting as much frame as we
want, but I found that the error might be accumulated. I use t
frames
for learning matrices and predict 100 new frames. <br>

<br>

I found that although equation (10) in the paper works for n, k, and t
values, the solution is more stable when n(k - 1) &lt;= t. This can
also be viewed as the number of equation constraints should be equal to
or larger than the number of unknown variables in the system of linear
equations. There are nnk unknown variables and each frame (except the
first k frames) provides n equations. So there is (t-k)n equations. So
when n(k - 1) &lt;= t, the number of equations is no less than the
number of unknown variables. Although we can use the pseudo inverse to
solve the system of linear equations as equation (10) in the paper, I
enforce n(k - 1) &lt;= t in my experiment to ensure solution stability.<br>

(t frames) and the right video is the result (t + 100 frames).<br>

I use t = 200, n = 10 and k = 10 in this experiment.

I use t = 200, n = 50 and k = 3 in this experiment.
I use more principal components because this scene is more dynamic and
requires more bases.<br>

I use t = 300, n = 50 and k = 5 in this experiment.
There are artifact near the end due to accumulated error.<br>
